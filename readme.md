# üö≤ Bay Wheels (Ford GoBike) Data Exploration and Visualization

Bay Wheels, previously known as **Ford GoBike**, is a bike-sharing system operating in California's San Francisco Bay Area. Launched on **August 29, 2013**, and currently owned by **Lyft**, it is one of the largest regional bike-sharing programs, providing over 262 stations for convenient and sustainable city travel.

This project involves an extensive **exploration and visualization** of public data provided by Bay Wheels, covering trips from **January 2018 to December 2019**. The aim is to uncover insights into user behavior, travel patterns, and operational dynamics using Python data analysis libraries.

## üìä Dataset Overview

- **Rows**: 4,370,704  
- **Columns**: 15  
- **Timeframe**: January 2018 ‚Äì December 2019  

Each record in the dataset represents a single trip and includes the following features:

- `trip_duration`: Duration of the ride (in seconds)
- `start_time`, `end_time`: Date and time of trip start and end
- `start_station_id`, `end_station_id`: Unique identifiers for stations
- `start_station_name`, `end_station_name`: Names of the stations
- `start_station_latitude`, `start_station_longitude`: GPS location of start station
- `end_station_latitude`, `end_station_longitude`: GPS location of end station
- `bike_id`: Identifier of the bike used
- `user_type`: Subscriber (member) or Customer (casual user)
- `bike_share_for_all_trip`: Indicates if the bike share program applies
- `rental_access_method`: Access method used for bike rental (e.g., app, card)

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and wrangling for accurate analysis
- Explore temporal trends in ride frequency and duration
- Identify peak usage times by day, hour, and season
- Compare behavior between subscribers and customers
- Map geospatial patterns of trip starts and ends
- Visualize key insights with clear and effective plots

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for static visualizations  
- **Plotly** and **Folium** (optional) for interactive plots and maps

---

## üßπ Data Preparation

- Converted date/time columns to appropriate datetime format
- Filtered and corrected anomalies in trip duration and location data
- Handled missing and duplicate entries
- Created new features: ride hour, day of week, user type categorization

---

## üìç Key Insights (Examples)

- **Subscribers** take significantly more rides than casual customers
- **Weekdays** see higher ride volume, especially during **commute hours**
- **Weekends** show a higher proportion of casual customers
- **Downtown San Francisco** is the most active zone for ride starts and ends
- Short trips (<15 mins) dominate, aligning with commuter usage patterns
